Capstone Proposal

The goal of the website is to allow users to search for songs, albums, and artists on Spotify, and to create playlists of their favorite songs.

The demographic of users will likely be music lovers of all ages who use Spotify to listen to music.

The data that will be used is the Spotify API, which provides information about songs, albums, artists, and playlists.

The approach to creating the project is as follows:

Database schema: The database will store user information, such as login credentials and playlist information.

Issues with API: 
Error handling and debugging: When interacting with the Spotify API, I may encounter various error responses or unexpected behavior. Proper error handling and debugging techniques will be necessary to identify and resolve these issues.

Sensitive information: User login credentials will need to be secured.

Functionality: The app will allow users to search for songs, albums, and artists on Spotify, and to create playlists of their favorite songs. Users will be able to save their playlists and view them later.

User flow: Users will be able to search for songs, albums, and artists on the home page. They will be able to create an account or log in to an existing account to save their playlists. Once logged in, they will be able to create new playlists, add songs to existing playlists, and view their saved playlists.

Features: In addition to the basic CRUD functionality, the app will include features such as the ability to share playlists with other users and to view recommended songs based on the user's listening history. Stretch goals could include integrating with other music services, such as Apple Music or YouTube Music, and adding social features, such as the ability to follow other users and view their 
playlists.
